## Readme
I first chose NFT MarketPlace but after spending days on the project I realized that it was going to take much more time than i had expected and i had my finals coming up so i changed my project and started working on a different project. 

I worked on it as much as i could but due to my finals being right around the corner i was unable to finish this project on time. My finals end on the 1st of June and i will only have enough time to finish the project after my exams. 

I realize that im still submitting this late and it is still not complete. i highly apologize for this and if you consider this project to be good enough then i'll be highly thankful if not then, i'll try next time. Insha'Allah! ðŸ˜„
